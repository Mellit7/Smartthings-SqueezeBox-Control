# **Smartthings Squeezebox Player Install SmartApp**

Version 1.0

If you have several players to install you may find it easier to use the Player Installation SmartApp.  It will search for all players defined in the Logitech Media Server and allow you to choose from that list which player(s) you wish to install.  This eliminates the need to find and enter MAC addresses for each player.

Before using the app, the server device must have been set up as described in steps 1-3 of the Installation Instructions in the README document. The SmartApp is used instead of step 4 in those instructions.  This app is a completely optional method to install players and the manual method still works.


### **SmartApp Player Installation Instructions**

After publishing the smartapp, run it by finding it under the My Apps section of Add a SmartApp.

Select the Media Server you want to add players to.  Tap Next.

After a few seconds the "Looking for Players" message should change to show the number of available players found and a list of already installed players.  Tap to select the desired players for the available list.  Tap Done on the player selection list.  You should see a list of the players you selected to install. Tap Next to begin the installation process.

After a few seconds you will see the results of the installation process, including players installed, already installed players, and players that failed to install.  **This list is build from only the players you selected on the prior screen.**

From this screen you can save the SmartApp for future use, but it is not necessary.  It is not needed for the players to operate correctly.  If you want to keep your list of installed SmartApps small, you can remove the app at this time.  If you need it again, simply follow these steps again.
